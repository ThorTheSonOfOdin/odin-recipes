        <h1>Pie</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A delicious pie recipe from someone's husband's mother who is French. Beef,
            pork and potato are all nicely spiced and baked into a pie. It's yummy and 
            pretty easy to make too! Best served fresh, but you can also make ahead
            and freeze or refrigerate. 
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium potato, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1/3 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried sage</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the potato in a
                saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender,
                about 5 minutes. Drain, mash, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, crumble the ground beef and pork into a large saucepan, and add 
                the garlic, onion and water. Season with mustard powder, thyme, cloves and 
                salt. Cook over medium hear, stirring to crumble the meat and mix in the spices, 
                until the mear is evenly browned. Remove from the heat, and mix in the mashed
                potato.
            </li>
            <li>Place one of the pie crusts into a 9 inch pie plate. Fill with the meat mixture,
                then top with the other pie crust. Prick the top crust a few times with a knife
                to vent steam. Crimp around the deges using the tines of the fork, and remove any
                excess dough. Cover the edges of the pie crust with aluminium foil.
            </li>
            <li>Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the crust has browned. Serve
                by itself, or with a beef gravy. 
            </li>
        </ol>
